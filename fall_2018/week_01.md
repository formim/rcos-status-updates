## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

In the past week, I have installed a linux distribution onto my machine and have installed the necessary software packages to begin working in the right direction.
Otherwise, I have continued the Angular tutorial and am almost finished.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

This week, I plan on finishing the Angular tutorial and taking a look at the two admin issues.  I still have to decide on which issues I should focus on, but I am planning on
looking at issues #195 and #122.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

Major blockers would be my inexperience with Angular as well as my lack of familiarity with the structure of the YACS project.  Along with that, I have other coursework and quizzes
that may take up my time.
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
