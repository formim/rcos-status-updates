In the past week, I continued to work on the Angular tutorial and reinstalled my ng and npm packages so that the YACS Admin repo would work on my machine.  
## This Week's Plan

Now that I finally had a local version of the YACS Admin portion working, I will begin to look at the issues listed on the github.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I still have to familiarize myself with the structure of the project and how Angular works, as well as study for my other courses and prep for interviews this week.
