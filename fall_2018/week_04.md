In the past week, I've managed to get the yacs-admin page running locally so that I can visualize and begin to work on issues.

This week, I will look at the list of issues on Github and see which ones I can tackle in a reasonable timeframe.  I've begun looking into how to implement a loading animation, and I am thinking about making a couple to maybe see what people think.
## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I have homework assignments and labs for my other classes, as well as quite a bit of traveling to do for an on-site interview in Boston this week.
