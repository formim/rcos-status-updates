## Last Week's Accomplishments

I spent some time updating my repo and reading about html conversion tools and methods (particularly to export to pdf).  Unfortunately, I didn't spend as much time as I had
planned on RCOS this past week.
## This Week's Plan

I've again got a working environment and have been looking at how the calendar / schedule visual components are organized.  My plan is to speak with Ada and other people who have
worked on the YACS frontend about how the calendar information is cached and stored, as to formulate a better plan to decide how to export to PDF, and how to parse the angular
components to form a valid ICS file.
## Anything Blocking?

I have an exam on Thursday that I am studying for, but I am hoping that I will spend more time on YACS this week.
