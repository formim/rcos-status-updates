## Last Week's Accomplishments

I spent time researching methods on how to compose ICS files via features included in Angular.  However, I realized that the ICS and download features are already implemented in the Beta version of YACS.
## This Week's Plan

Since realizing that the ICS download already exists in the Beta, I'll spend the next few days looking at the Javascript code and get something working in our Angular overhaul.  On top of this, I will hopefully iron out some bugs in the ICS file's scheduling.
## Anything Blocking?

I have an Algorithms midterm coming up soon, as well as homework for other classes that may take some time away from what I want to do on this project.
