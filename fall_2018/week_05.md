## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I've taken a closer look at the YACS frontend components and am still trying to figure everything out.  I got word from Ada that she had changed something up regarding
the version of Angular we should be using, so I will take a look into that to make sure I'm using the right environment.
## This Week's Plan

I've been tasked with fixing up the calendar toolbar UI and implementing a calendar download.  I'll be reading about how to do both of these.
## Anything Blocking?

I am particularly busy with work for my other classes, but will try to get started with my tasks.
