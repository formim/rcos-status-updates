## Last Week's Accomplishments

I implemented Copy Schedule Link to work with yacs-web and typescript.  Also made (small) minor changes to the download buttons.
## This Week's Plan

Get Docker working again, and focus on implementing ICS download.  
## Anything Blocking?

Course work for other classes are always a blocker, but I feel that I need to improve my YACS contributions so will do my best to get it all finished.
